## Goals
- Provide a user-friendly movie selection platform.
- Gather and maintain a useful database of movie reviews.
- Compare user-based and content-based recommendation systems.
- Showcase the abilities of language models in daily tasks.

---

## Frameworks and Tools
- **Data Collection:** `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, `Selenium`
- **Database Setup:** `PostgreSQL`
- **Recommendation System:** `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`
- **Review Summarization:** `T5`, `FineBERT`
- **Interactive Dashboard:** `Flask`, `HTML`, `CSS`

---

## Limitations
1. The movie database is restricted to 22,893 titles, limiting recommendations to this set.
2. Performance is impacted due to the use of language models and recommendation models on a local machine with limited processing power, resulting in slower execution.
